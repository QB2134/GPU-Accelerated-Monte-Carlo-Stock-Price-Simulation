# GPU-Accelerated-Monte-Carlo-Stock-Price-Simulation
This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation of stock-price dynamics under Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) using CuPy (GPU) for large-scale stochastic modeling and option pricing. It visualizes sample price paths, the empirical terminal distribution, and overlays the theoretical log-normal PDF for validation.
